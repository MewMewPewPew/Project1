## Project 1
- make use of javascript to interact with the DOM.
- Artist statement
    - presentation/game testing February 24th
    - Submit on March 5th
## Plan/Ideas 
- Love the Ascii aesthetic
- Would like to mix sound with it as well ? or video
- js events: click, ALERT :3, ...
- WHAT DO WE WANT TO SAY OR TALK ABOUT ? (ideas)
    - digital person (like mouchette):
    - OR TAMAGOCHI !!!!!
    ### Digi Chiika 
    - buttons that are like eyes, when pressed, blink
        - make them look around ? (mouse position, random, other button, ...)
    - communication? 
        - needs ? 
    - sound? 
        - Music :3
        - Vocaloid like response ? sounds
        - maybe it can make noises depending on state
    - Visuals: have an img/video background, have a "window like" on it, representing Digi Chiika 
        - have a button to change the img/video background
            - space, beach, mountain, big city landscape,...
        + +make Digi Chiika "respond" to it (emotions)
            - different emotional states.. responds to actions or time based?
            - how will it react? animation or change in sprite? maybe change in color? maybe sounds?
    - will it speak? if so we can think of speech bubbles..
        - doesn't need to speak in "our" languages.. could be in symbols? binary? maybe ascii?
    - state ideas..
        - happy (play)
        - sad (what would trigger it?)
        - sleep (VS awake)
        - hungry (if food system is added)
    - battery system instead of energy?
        - adjacent to a health system?
        - maybe make it rest when battery becomes red..
            - recharges?
